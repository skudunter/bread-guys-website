# The bread people website

Is a website I built in next.hs using **Open** as a **free React / Next.js landing page template built with Tailwind CSS** for developers/makers who want to create a quick and professional landing page for their open source projects, SaaS products, online services, and more.

I built this project by creating my own api endpoints and using sqllite as a database to store user data in next.js to challenge myself and become a better programmer I hope you find some use for it.

## how to run
***You will need to add a .env.local file to your root and add the missing COOKIE_NAME value***
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Bugs
The urls are absolute and point to localhost:3000
